## Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

This project considers the multiclass classification problem of sentiment analysis of Tweets. The goal of this project is to develop various deep learning models to classify Tweets based on their text content using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Different deep learning architectures for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models were explored and compared against traditional machine learning methods, such as gradient boosted trees and multilayer perceptrons. This was completed as a final project for STAT 362 at Northwestern University in Fall 2025.
