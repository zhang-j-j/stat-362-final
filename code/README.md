- `FINAL_baseline.ipynb`: Baseline models (MLP, XGBoost)
- `FINAL_bidirectional_rnn.ipynb`: Bidirectional RNN models
- `FINAL_embedding_model.ipynb`: Compare embedding models
- `FINAL_gated_rnn.ipynb`: Gated RNN models
- `FINAL_overall_analysis.ipynb`: Final analysis of best models
- `FINAL_transformer.ipynb`: Transformer model
- `FINAL_vanilla_rnn.ipynb`: Vanilla RNN models
- `util_funcs.py`: Defines helper functions
